-Use of HandPose Model from Tensorflow and FingerPose

-I made the model recognize the numbers 1 to 9 in Abacus Hand Techniques and created functions to find the sum of the provided numbers. Each number is purposely made to be recognized in 2 seconds. 

-I Got Guidance from Nicholas Renotte to Set Up the HandPose Model
