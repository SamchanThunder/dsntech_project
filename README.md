How To Use: Use the Abacus Hand Method to input numbers **(1 to 9)** on the screen. Make a Fist to add numbers. Curl all your fingers and keep your pinky up to subtract numbers.

-Use of HandPose Model from Tensorflow and FingerPose

-I made the model recognize the numbers 1 to 9 in Abacus Hand Techniques and created functions to do different calculations with the provided numbers. Each number is purposely made to be recognized in 2 seconds.
